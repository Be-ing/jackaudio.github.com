A new version of JACK2 has just been released.<br/>
You can grab the latest release source code at
<https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/releases> and macOS/Windows installers at
<https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2-releases/releases>.

This release focuses on improvements to the macOS and Windows binaries, now with macOS universal builds natively supporting macOS M1 hardware.<br/>
On M1 hardware, you can now have native arm64 JACK clients talk to Intel/x64 once and vice-versa.

On Windows, JACK-Router (the special ASIO driver that allows any ASIO-compatible application to talk to other JACK clients)
has been brought back, now integrated with the installer so it is much easier to manage.<br/>
Also, 32-bit and 64-bit clients can now be mixed without any side-effects to the meta-data.

Please restart the JACK server after updating to 1.9.17 on those systems.

The official changelog is:
* Add jack-router to Windows installer, opt-in
* Fix jack_control stopping after first command iteration
* Fix library compat/current version under macOS
* Fix registry keys for Windows, add 32bit compat ones on 64bit
* Fix return codes of jackd on success
* Ignore DB_VERSION_MISMATCH error on windows, it is expected
* Remove old workaround for asio4all, as it breaks with jack-router
* Support for arm64 macOS builds
* Show welcome and license pages on windows installer
* Update QjackCtl used in macOS/Windows installers to v0.9.0, with some commits cherry-picked from develop branch
